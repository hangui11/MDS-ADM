# Algorithmics for Data Mining

This repository contains three main topics related to **Algorithmics for Data Mining**.

---

### ðŸ“š Contents

* **Backpropagation Project**

  Includes the code and report exploring gradient flow and logic function learning using the backpropagation algorithm in neural networks. Emphasis is placed on understanding how gradients propagate and how networks learn simple logic tasks like AND, OR, and XOR.

* **Boosting Project**

  Focuses on the theoretical foundations of boosting, with a particular emphasis on the concept of **margin theory** and a detailed analysis of key boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost.

* **NODE Project (Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles)**

  Combines theory and experiments to understand and implement NODEsâ€”an interpretable neural network architecture designed for structured (tabular) data.
